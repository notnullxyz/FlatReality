# README #

FlatReality is the codename for the virtual world project. If you have to ask, you probably don't need it.

## Development ##

### Get up and running ###
* Clone
* `npm install`
* `webpack`
* Run the simple python webserver on your dev container/machine `./simplePythonHttpd.py`
* Browse to the dist/ build on `http://localhost:8000/dist/`

### Code ###
* Create a feature branch off **dev** `git checkout -b 20160910_someFeature` (or whatever really)
* Commit often.
* Create a PR to merge back to **dev**

I am aiming to keep `master` fairly pristine and production ready. Chaos may thrive in a controlled way in `dev` however, but feature branches are absolutely neccesary.

### Last but not least ###

For the sake of order and all things spicy:

* Comment well, and/or:
* Document on WIKI
* Make/edit/update Issues/Tickets

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Repo owner Marlon van der Linde <marlon250f@gmail.com> or <marlon@notnull.xyz>
* Any of the developers on the project...
* Alternatively, pop into Slack on Strange-Cargo -> #code :-)
